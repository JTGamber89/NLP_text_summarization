# NLP_text_summarization
Exploration of the transformer model architecture for text summarization NLP tasks

This project follows the `Transformers for Long Text, Code Examples with Longformer` article by Christian Versloot and seeks to apply the Longformer model to a text summarization task.  The eventual goal of this project is to apply the model to an NLP for Surveys tool to summarize key themes from survey responses.
