Many models, however, output the values right before the softmax is applied, which are also known as the *logits*. We need to tell the loss function that thatâ€™s what our model does, and the only way to do that is to call it directly, rather than by name with a string."

    "If you try the above code, it certainly runs, but youâ€™ll find that the loss declines only slowly or sporadically. The primary cause is the *learning rate*. As with the loss, when we pass Keras the name of an optimizer as a string, Keras initializes that optimizer with default values for all parameters, including learning rate. From long experience, though, we know that transformer models benefit from a much lower learning rate than the default for Adam, which is 1e-3, also written as 10 to the power of -3, or 0.001. 5e-5 (0.00005), which is some twenty times lower, is a much better starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to lowering the learning rate, we have a second trick up our sleeve: We can slowly reduce the learning rate over the course of training. In the literature, you will sometimes see this referred to as *decaying* or *annealing* the learning rate. In Keras, the best way to do this is to use a *learning rate scheduler*. A good one to use is `PolynomialDecay` â€” despite the name, with default settings it simply linearly decays the learning rate from the initial value to the final value over the course of training, which is exactly what we want. In order to use a scheduler correctly, though, we need to tell it how long training is going to be. We compute that as `num_train_steps` below."
